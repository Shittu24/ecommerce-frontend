## Project Structure

Our Angular eCommerce frontend project follows this directory structure:

1. **`src/app`:** Contains the Angular components, modules, and services.

2. **`src/assets`:** Includes static assets like images, styles, and fonts.

3. **`src/environments`:** Configuration files for different environments (e.g., production, development).

4. **`src/index.html`:** The main HTML file that loads the Angular application.

5. **`angular.json`:** Angular CLI configuration file.

6. **`package.json`:** Lists project dependencies and scripts.

7. **`tsconfig.json`:** TypeScript configuration file.


## Development

During development, you can use the Angular CLI commands to streamline your workflow:

1. **Generate a new component, service, or module:**

   ```bash
   ng generate component my-component

2. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   ng test

3. **Build application:**

   ```bash
   ng build
   
This will generate a dist/ folder with the production-ready code.

## Building for Production

Before deploying the application to a production server, build it using the following command:

    ```bash
    ng build --prod

  This will optimize the application for production, and you can find the output in the dist/ directory.
